ERP QUOTATIONS AUTOMATION PLATFORM BUILDER

This project is an ERP-based Quotation Builder System designed to streamline the complete lifecycle of procurement, quotation management, and billing within an enterprise. It features secure API authentication using JWT and role-based access control, assigning users as Suppliers, Consumers, Customers, or Distributors. The system organizes all products into structured Categories and Sub-Categories such as Fluid Mechanics, Welder, Store Executive, Building Construction Model, Highway Engineering Model, Irrigation Engineering Model, and Painter. Each section contains detailed items—for example, under Highway Engineering Model, items like Model of a Building Showing Different Components are maintained with their quantity, pricing, and assigned supplier.

The system also manages Raw Materials, such as a Centrifugal Pump, where supplier details, stock quantity, and pricing are tracked and added to quotation lists. A dedicated Catalog Management module allows uploading technical drawings and machine designs for reference. The Quotation Module supports a complete approval workflow with statuses including Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, and Finalized. Once a quotation is approved, it is seamlessly converted into an invoice by selecting the customer and associated quotation.

The Billing Module automatically calculates all financial components such as GST, TDS, delivery charges, transport commission, and insurance, generating a finalized and accurate invoice. Overall, this ERP system enhances operational efficiency, ensures data accuracy, provides supplier transparency, and delivers a structured and automated approach to procurement, quotation handling, and billing across the organization.
